# drlnd-project-2
Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning

# The Environment
For this project, we will work with the [Unity ML-Agents environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md)

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

# This repository
This repository includes the solution using a single agent (there is another version with 20 identical agents)

# Solving the Environment
To solve the environement the agent need to get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.
